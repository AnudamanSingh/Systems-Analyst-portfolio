# System Monitoring and Analysis

## Context
As part of daily operations, I monitor system health and performance
to ensure availability, stability, and timely detection of issues.

## Signals Observed
- Monitoring alerts for CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- Application warnings and error logs
- Performance degradation reported by users

## Analysis Performed
- Reviewed system and application logs
- Analyzed performance metrics to identify trends
- Correlated alerts with system activity and scheduled processes

## Actions Taken
- Identified root causes of abnormal system behavior
- Recommended configuration adjustments or process changes
- Escalated confirmed issues with supporting evidence

## Outcome
- Reduced incident response time
- Improved system stability through early detection
- Better visibility into recurring system patterns

## Systems Analytics Demonstrated
- Continuous system monitoring
- Log and metrics analysis
- Root cause identification
- Operational decision support
