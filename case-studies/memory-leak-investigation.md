# Memory Leak Investigation via Long-Running Process Analysis

## Context
Systems experienced gradual performance degradation over extended uptime.

## Signal
- Increasing memory usage
- Performance degradation without CPU spikes
- Temporary resolution after restart

## Analysis
- Monitored memory utilization trends
- Identified long-running processes with abnormal growth
- Correlated patterns with application modules

## Action
- Restarted affected services
- Documented memory growth behavior
- Shared findings with application teams

## Outcome
- Improved system stability
- Reduced unplanned interruptions
- Data provided for permanent remediation

## Systems Analytics Demonstrated
- Trend analysis
- Resource monitoring
- Evidence-based root cause identification
